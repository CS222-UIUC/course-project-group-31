Project Idea: UIUC Course Recommeder

Project Pitch: A website that recommends courses based on a student's interests and background (year, major, etc.)

Functionality: The functionality includes a list of courses a certain student should take using student reviews, their background, and course requirements. There will also be an option to browse popular courses (based on ratings). If time permits, we can also include a feature that generates a schedule that works well for each student.

Programming Languages: React.js for the front end, mySQL database.

Major Libraries Used: React library, Express NodeJS library, Python Flask library

Testing Methodology:  Unsure if we will have time for testing, github actions have not been functioning properly, so we may just use unit testing.

Components: The project offers a login and signup component. It also has an add course and post course review component.

Interactions With Other Components: We will independently store the courses for each student to their ID produced upon login.

Continuous Integration: We will write unit tests for the python flask and use the browser console with react js to make sure everything is proceeding as planned.
