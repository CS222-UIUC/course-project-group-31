Project Idea: UIUC Course Recommeder

Project Pitch: A website that recommends courses based on a student's interests and background (year, major, etc.)

Functionality: The functionality includes a list of courses a certain student should take using student ratings, their background, and course requirements. There will also be an option to browse popular courses (based on ratings). If time permits, we can also include a feature that generates a schedule that works well for each student.

Programming Languages: React.js for the front end, Python Flask for the backend storing into a SQL database.

Major Libraries Used: React library, Python Flask library

Testing Methodology:  Unsure if we will have time for testing, github actions have not been functioning properly, so we may just use unit testing.

Components: The project has a scheduling component and login component to it. 

Interactions With Other Components: We will independently store the courses for each student to their UID produced upon login.

Continuous Integration: We will write unit tests for the python flask and use the browser console with react js to make sure everything is proceeding as planned.
